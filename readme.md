# 🔄 What is Loop Terminator? 🛡️

Loop Terminator is your one-stop solution for detecting and preventing network loops. 🕵️‍♂️🚫💻

## 💡 How it works

Loop Terminator scans your network topology and monitors network traffic to detect anomalous traffic patterns. 🕵️‍♀️👀📈

It then identifies the source interface for anomalous traffic and disables it temporarily to prevent further loops. 🛑🔌💥

Loop Terminator can also detect and handle multiple loops, ensuring that your network runs smoothly without any downtime. 🔄🔒💻

## 🚀 Get started

To get started with Loop Terminator, simply clone the repository and run the program on your network. 📥👨‍💻💻

## 📈 Roadmap

In the future, we plan to add more features to Loop Terminator, such as:

-   Automatic recovery of disabled interfaces
-   Real-time alerts for anomalous traffic patterns
-   Integration with popular network monitoring tools

Stay tuned for more updates! 🤖👀🚀
